			<h1>Crocheting From Scratch</h1>
			<h3>What will you learn?</h3>
			<ol id="index">
				<li><a href="#history">History</a></li>
			</ol>
			<p>This website will provide how to crochet, the history, and newly made recipes.</p> 
			<h3>What You'll Need</h3>
			<ul>
				<li>Yarn, Wool, or Cotton (Not Recommended)</li>
				<li>Crochet Hook</li>
				<li>Crochet Marker, Hair Pin (Substitute)</li>
			</ul>
			<p>I'd recommend you buy the materials from Target, Amazon, or Micheal's, whichever's closest to you. If you have a spare hair pin, you could use it, crochet markers are only for learning like training wheels or if you're doing a longer than one day project, it's nice to have one for those kind of things.</p>

			<p>Crocheting is a process of creating textiles by using a crochet hook to interlock loops of yarn, thread, or strands of other materials. The name is derived from the French term crochet, meaning 'small hook'. Hooks can be made from a variety of materials, such as metal, wood, bamboo, or plastic. The key difference between crochet and knitting, beyond the implements used for their production, is that each stitch in crochet is completed before the next one is begun, while knitting keeps many stitches open at a time. Some variant forms of crochet, such as Tunisian crochet and broomstick lace, do keep multiple crochet stitches open at a time.</p>
			<h3 id="slip-knot">The Slip (Pretzel) Knot</h3>
			<p class="steps">The slip knot is the base of everything in crocheting, no matter what the craft you're gonna need this.<br>
			    <span class="step-num">1</span>
			    Start off by making a tiny, circular ring by maybe rapping it around your index finger, then pull it a little to make it smaller.<br>
			    <span class="step-num">2</span> Then, pull from any sides around your ring, and put the closer part to the ring into the ring, pull on the opposing side you stuck the extra line in, make sure you don't let the open side to go in the ring, that results in a dead knot.<br><br>
			    Practice this a few times, experiment! Does your knot look like a pretzel? If not, try again until you master it, it took me a while to figure out, so don't think to hard about it. Let yourself rest for a moment.
