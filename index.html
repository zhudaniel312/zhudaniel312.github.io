			<h3>What will you learn?
			<ol id="index">
				<li><a href="#history">History</a></li>
			</ol>
			<p>This website will provide how to crochet, the history, and newly made recipes.</p> 
			<h3>What You'll Need</h3>
			<ul>
				<li>Yarn, Wool, or Cotton (Not Recommended)</li>
				<li>Crochet Hook</li>
				<li>Crochet Marker, Hair Pin (Substitute)</li>
			</ul>
			<p>I'd recommend you buy the materials from Target, Amazon, or Micheal's, whichever's closest to you. If you have a spare hair pin, you could use it, crochet markers are only for learning like training wheels or if you're doing a longer than one day project, it's nice to have one for those kind of things.</p>

				<h6 class="warning">THIS IS FROM WIKIPEDIA, SOURCES ON THE BOTTOM</h6>
			<p>Crocheting is a process of creating textiles by using a crochet hook to interlock loops of yarn, thread, or strands of other materials. The name is derived from the French term crochet, meaning 'small hook'. Hooks can be made from a variety of materials, such as metal, wood, bamboo, or plastic. The key difference between crochet and knitting, beyond the implements used for their production, is that each stitch in crochet is completed before the next one is begun, while knitting keeps many stitches open at a time. Some variant forms of crochet, such as Tunisian crochet and broomstick lace, do keep multiple crochet stitches open at a time.</p>
